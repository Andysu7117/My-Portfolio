# My-Portfolio
A portfolio of all the work I have coded up to now

## Project Description 
This project is a portfolio of my work using all the concepts I have learnt so far. It includes concepts such as Flexbox, CSS selectors and others. The code used to code this project was HTML and CSS, the only 2 codes I have learnt so far. The hardest aspect of this project was implementing Flexbox, in this project it's not perfect but I have grasped a better understanding of this for future projects.
